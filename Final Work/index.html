Sometimes the thought of planning a funeral seems too difficult for those who've suffered a loss. We're here to help lighten your burden and remind you of the true value a ceremony can hold for you and your family. </p>
<p class="services">Burial Services: 
 
<P class="services">
<font class="font">Immediate Burial</font> means that your loved one's physical remains will be buried or entombed without a public service or gathering. </P>
<p class="services">
<font class="font">Vistation</font> (also called a "viewing", "wake" or "calling hours") allows family and friends to gather in a room with the departed loved one (which can be in an open or closed casket) and gives everyone the opportunity to say goodbye and offer their support and sympathy to the bereaved. </p></font>
<p class="services">
<font class="font">Funeral or Memorial Serivces</font> can take place at a funeral home, in a church or even at your home. The service is a ceremony which serves to celebrate, honor, and remember the life of the deceased. Whether traditional or unique, both the visitation and the funeral service can be personalized to reflect the individuality of your loved one. </p>
<P class="services">
<font class="font">Graveside, Chapel, or Committal Services </font>
are held at the cemetery, and allow family and friends to be present as their loved one is transferred to his or her final disposition through ground burial.</p>
